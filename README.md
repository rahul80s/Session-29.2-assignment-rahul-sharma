Acagild session 29.2 assignment 

Below your table, create a graph showing the students’ rounded averages. Be sure to
include appropriate labeling and spacing, so that the graph is non-repetitive and the
scale is appropriate. Hint: A score of 100 is the highest possible.

• 1) Insert a new worksheet. Use the Goal Seek feature to find the value that Eugene needed on Test 1 in order to earn honors 
for the course. Show your work by displaying anupdated table. Title the worksheet “Eugene’s dream.” Hint: Do not worry about
rounding Eugene’s new “score” for Test 1. If done properly, the rest of your table should update accordingly.


• 2) From the data on your “class list” worksheet, provide the Descriptive Statistics of your
students’ rounded averages. For the output, create a new worksheet and choose to
display “summary statistics”. Rename this worksheet “Descriptive Statistics”.
